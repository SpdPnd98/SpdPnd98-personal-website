As part of my "One project a day" challenge (read (here) [https://modelconverge.xyz/2020/12/13/I-did-a-project-a-day/] on what I did on a high level), I wanted to program a PWM driver for a pan tilt camera. I considered a lot of variations, even thinking of designing one on my own, and eventually stumbled upon this Pan-Tilt camera remixed by (Msystemsrl)[https://www.thingiverse.com/msystemsrl/designs]. It was a perfect proof of concept for me!

This print has altogether 8 parts. 3 for the camera, 2 for the base of the camera, 2 for tilt direction, and 1 for the base as well as the pan direction. I faced some tolerance issues, but was able to correct them easily by snipping some parts off with a wire cutter. 

Here is the camera in parts:

Due to my lack of screws and servo horns, I had to hotglue some portions together.

Here is the full assembly:

This device was almost perfect, it only had one flaw: why is it front heavy? >.< I was kind of disappointed when the finished assembly couldn't stand on its own. Nevertheless, it still works if I tape it down to a surface.
