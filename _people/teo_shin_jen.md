A true mentor at heart. He has been me and my team's North Star for many hackathons and competitions participated in Singapore Polytechnic. He teaches me not only technical skills, but also how to pitch solutions, evaluate real/fake opportunities, 3H dynamics in a team,and his legendary TCM formula.
