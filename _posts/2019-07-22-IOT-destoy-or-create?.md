# Preface
As a fortunate student studying in Diploma in Computer Engineering, taking the Smart City Specialization, I am fortunate enough to be a student of Mr Teo Shin Jen. He is an awesome lecturer posting a lot of resources for us students, ensuring we learn useful and practical information to do security in IoT device. We were exposed to an article about the whole process of a startup's employee monitoring device, which an employee curiously removed it from him work station to dismantle and disect, exposing the weaknesses of the product and giving his suggestions on how to improve it. I'd like to also share my not-so-long two cents to this extremely long article.

# Destruction
The author first took the sensor down from his work station, which was attached under the table with magnets. Furthermore, the device is easily dismantled without requiring special tools. I can understand the startup's idea of quick to market but i agree more to the author's POV on hardware security. From a maker' perspective however, it is very discouraging as simpler things get complicated very quickly. The casing needs to be redesigned just to cater to people that are curious as to make them lose interest in hacking instead, possibly compromising on aesthetics and usability. Meawhile, this action of redesigning cannot completely deter everyone from hacking this IoT device. Vulnerabilities are found by the creative minds. One small misconsideration would be endlessly criticized by certain "nerfarious" individuals, even if they have their best interest at heart.

Next, the author goes through the device in more and more detail, finding the model of the hardware used, looking for dataset, every retriving te bin file
